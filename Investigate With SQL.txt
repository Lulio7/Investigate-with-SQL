Investigate With SQL

/* 
On October 23rd, 2021 Kehinde Wiley's, infamous painting, "Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps" 
was stolen from the New York City Metropolitan Museum of Art. The only evidence that the authorities 
have is a digital evidence file containing flight, bank, cell phone and other related data. 
Because of a lack of expertise, the authorities have been unable to analyze the file to make any headway 
in the case. Now, this is where you and I come in. Together we are the last and only resort for cracking 
the case. We're going to work together and use our SQL data skills to do four specific things. 

1. Analyze the data.
2. Gather evidence.
3. Find the thieves and the painting..

/*

Objective: Final step in the analytical journey to solve a case involving the theft of a painting.
Method: Manual analysis of text messages to identify additional evidence and pinpoint the thieves.
Query Focus: Text messages sent between October 20th and October 25th by the suspects identified previously.

Analysis Process:
Bruce and Brenda:
Bruce arrived in New York on October 20th.
Brenda arrived in New York and planned to meet Bruce at the museum on October 21st to "run through the plan."

Subsequent messages confirmed their plans and involvement in the theft.
Aleana and Leonardo:
Aleana arrived in New York and planned to meet Leonardo, but these messages were less suspicious and neither were on the initial suspect list.

Suspicious Messages:
October 21st:
Bruce confirmed to Brenda about finding a buyer for $1 million.
Brenda confirmed the arrangement and plan.
October 24th:
Bruce boasted about the successful theft and mentioned the value of the art.
Brenda wished Bruce a safe flight back.

Conclusion:
Bruce and Brenda are identified as the primary suspects.
Evidence gathered from their messages strongly indicates their involvement in the theft.
Analysis results are conclusive enough to be handed over to police authorities for making an arrest.
